# 😸 Greetings & Salutations, friends! 👋

Hi! I'm ***Claudia Justice Kane***
( [🦋 she](https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/she/her/her/hers/herself)

*God Queen Empress of the United States* (pending ascension), and real-life software engineer at [@Mattel](https://github.com/Mattel) since 2017.

I am involved in many intersecting fascinations in my role as a Staff Software Engineer, including:
* QA Test Automation (🌈 *the Origin Story* ✨)
* Connected Products Platform, performance & load testing
* Release & Delivery Automation, CI/CD orchestration, optimization, 
* Backend Services, OTA/asset delivery, OAuth2, RBAC, and OIDC integration
* R&D, Generative AI services, AI-augmented art, and

### ⚡ Fun Facts

* I attribute the seed that grew into my career to wrestling for the mouse with a friend when I as 11 years old on Neopets and accidentally finding the HTML source.
  * I emailed it to myself because I didn't know yet how we stumbled into the source code for Neopets and wanted to study it thinking maybe we could hack the system and get lots and lots of whatever the currency was called.
  * I ended up losing that account to hackers one night at 4am, gave away my own password and (relatively safely) learned a very important lesson in trust and risk assessment 😅

## 🥰 Testimonials

I sometimes struggle to recognize my worth, so I like to collect little testimonials that refute that [👿 DMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) in my head.

Here's is a short list of some of the kind words my peers and colleagues have said about me, & which I have also remembered to save in time to reflect and remember.

> GN and thanks for your leadership[^ctx-load-test]
> 
> — Sara Govindarajan, VP Enterprise Architecture, CTO Leadership, Mattel \
>  June 4, 2019

[^ctx-load-test]: **Context**: I took over a load test from a vendor that didn't deliver to our expectations to make a hard deadline, and then I over-delivered to my own very high standards with an impressive report bolstering confidence in the project at the very last minute.

    I do not want to ever have to do that again.

> 
> — [@dietb][@dietb], Principal Software Engineer, Mattel \
>  October 14, 2019

[^ctx-brett-dang]: **Context**: Our backend services encountered a very esoteric bug with no tangible information in logs.
From intuition and familiarity with the system, I identified within minutes exactly where in the code it was, and why.

    It was unusual and unbefitting to the typical behavior of the interface though, and so he'd spent some time investigating further before reaching the same conclusion.

    Once he had made the change I had suggested, the error was revealed and a quick Google search uncovered that we just needed to update dependencies, and now everyone remembers to handle the error even when typically the abstraction *should* never emit an error. 😁

### 🌟 *Glowing* Performance Reviews

<details>
  <summary><b>2019 Performance Review</b></summary>

<blockquote>
Claudia is an exemplary employee who creates realistic, yet challenging, goals and accomplishes what she sets out to do.
She has been involved in nearly every project that the MCPP organization has been involved in.
Notably, with Hot Wheels ID, Claudia was involved in the development and testing of backend and mobile code, backend performance testing code, test automation systems, and has been actively involved in the entire development lifecycle.

[…]

Claudia has also been a leader in evaluating technologies, contributes to engineering discussions, and works with others internally and externally to educate and inform.
 
Claudia takes great care to focus on accuracy and precision as a technical worker. She spends considerable time vetting, researching, and investigating to understand and explain her understanding to others.
These two characteristics can be seen through her attention to detail and fact finding.

I personally appreciate the lengths she goes through to work with team members and external consumers of our services and technologies.
She demonstrates patience and understanding, along with her clear and deep understanding of our larger platform.

  <summary><b>2020 Performance Review</b></summary>

<blockquote>
Claudia has done many amazing things this year.
She is single-handedly moving us to [CI/CD platform, _identity omitted_], which will greatly reduce the budget impact of needing a large number of users in [CI/CD platform, _identity omitted_] as well as VMs for Jenkins.
This also will reduce a lot of wasted effort that goes into maintaining the Jenkins CI, which is notoriously flakey and labor intensive, not to mention a security nightmare.[^ctx-jenkins-security]

Claudia has built a testing suite for several of our projects and is always the one that people turn to when they want to know if a system is working.
She also built a performance testing system from the ground up to ensure that Mattel Login would be ready for the launch of the new Hot Wheels Collectors Shopify site, backed by logins in Mattel Login.
Claudia built a testing platform for the mobile apps on [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io), which will make it vastly easier to increase the quality of those projects.
Claudia is always the most available of us on Teams, for answering questions and helping people from innumerable different teams.
Her knowledge of our systems is encyclopedic, and I am sure that no one else on our teams knows as many systems as well as she does.
Claudia is the one on our team who knows our DevOps systems the best and pushes to make our environments more stable, more flexible, and more maintainable.
Claudia has taken on the mantle of developer as well as tester, and she has contributed code to our core systems, taking on features and bug fixes and moving beyond "just" QA and devops.

Claudia is instrumental to the quality of the products that our team puts out - and the quality of several other teams.
She pushes for better use of Jira, better communication, better testing, and better support of running systems.
She interacts with many different teams and is well-known as someone who can help just about anyone with anything.
She is the consummate team player, and goes way above and beyond in her support of everyone on any impacted team.
Claudia continually makes Mattel a better place to work and treats other teams' concerns as important as our own.

[^ctx-jenkins-security]: maintaining these things costs effort and time of people who often have neither to spare :(

  <summary><b>2021 Performance Review</b></summary>

  <blockquote>

Claudia continues to be the go to person for anything CI/CD, and continues to be invaluable in the DevSecOps space even though that's not her place to be and she's an engineer now.

Her work on the Redirector[^redirector] for Auth0 was a happy accident research that turned into a necessary component to make the transition to auth0 successful.
It also fully cements her stake on the path to becoming a senior backend engineer because she organized and took ownership of this project from the start.

[…]

Considering the amount of work that the backend team has seen this past year, and the quality work that Claudia has produced, I can't recommend anything other than "Exceeded Results."

— [Todd Rafferty][@webrat], Senior Software Engineering Manager, Mattel \

  <blockquote>
</details>

[^redirector]: **Context**: I built and tested the _Email Verification Required_ feature for the new Mattel Login on Auth0.

    My implementation was fully capable of far exceeding any expectations of ingress volume, and I proved as much with automated performance under load testing I built into the service.

### Awards & Recognitions

<details>
  <summary><b>Standing Ovation</b></summary>

> **Nimble**: Embrace speed and agility.
> 
> Appreciate the great work for the relaunching of the Smart Connect App in an extremely compressed timeline across multiple platforms and create a platform to build upon for launching the next generation of connected products.

  <summary><b>Employee of the Month</b>, July 2019</summary>

> — Chris Goff, Manager, Tech Program Management, Mattel \
> July 8, 2019

**Context**: Coordinated with remote team across wide timezone gaps to recover catastrophic performance test under a tight deadline.</summary>

During June, I lead daily 8-hour meetings bringing together teams and all our vendors within India, England, US East, and US West to prepare our production environments and execute a test plan to prove our systems as a whole can realistically support our expected millions of monthly active players on the Hot Wheels id game platform.
